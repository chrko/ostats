OStats / OCollectâ€¦
-------------------

This is a project which I started a long time ago. I wanted to collect every
single accessible xml api file and data.
I'll quit my ogame activities so the code is published.
The data model is created to save every data point. It isn't optimized for
retrieving the stored information.

requirements:
- php7.0 debian, should be working with the more current release
- mariadb (mysql should work, too)
- composer

1. composer install
2. Copy config.example.php to config.php and adjust to your needs.
3. ./app.php gt:migrate && ./app.php gt:part
4. cat initial.list | xargs ./app.php gt:server:create --full-country

To collect the data you have to run (several) instances of "./app.php gt:worker".
I would recommend to get one priority worker for the highscore data:
	./app.php gt:worker highscore

To reorganize the partitions of the highscore run ./app.php gt:part.
You don't need to do this daily, but should do this at least every
2 weeks.
